## Project Comments:
This project was very comprehensive and was and effective way of introducing students to embedded system. The project covered all of data conversion as well as c to include how to create a Markdown file and a make file. Some of the function used in this project will be used later in this class and within the Embedded System program. With that being said future recommendations for future projects to include more concise programs with the same level of efficiency in topics learned.
